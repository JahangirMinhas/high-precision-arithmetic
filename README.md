# High-Precision Arithmetic Operations

A Fortran-based application that performs high-precision arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorial) on arbitrarily large integers using custom linked list data structures.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and factorial (`!`).
- Handles arbitrarily large integers with dynamic linked lists.
- Supports negative numbers and efficiently removes leading zeros.
- Implements paper-based algorithms for accuracy and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- A Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran`).
- Terminal or command line access.

## How to Compile

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JahangirMinhas/high-precision-arithmetic.git
   cd high-precision-arithmetic
